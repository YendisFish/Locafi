# Locafi

Hello, and welcome to the repository for Locafi. Locafi is meant
to be a small lightweight music player for you to listen to music
downloaded locally. But it has a twist! Locafi also allows you to
download youtube links as audio and listen to them. Although it is
still in development, Locafi has a promising development path.
